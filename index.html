                        The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Considered an
                        archetypal
                        masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known, the most
                        visited,
                        the most
                        written
                        about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The painting's novel qualities
                        include the
                        subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of
                        forms,
                        and
                        the
                        atmospheric
                        illusionism.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini,
                        the
                        wife of
                        Francesco del Giocondo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Leonardo never gave the
                        painting to the
                        Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left it in his will to his favored apprentice
                        Sala√¨.
