                    The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.
                    <br> <br>
                    Considered an
                    archetypal
                    masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known, the most visited,
                    the
                    most
                    written
                    about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".
                    <br><br>
                    The painting's novel qualities
                    include the
                    subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms,
                    and
                    the
                    atmospheric
                    illusionism.
                    <br><br>
                    The painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini,
                    the
                    wife of
                    Francesco del Giocondo.
                    <br><br>
                    It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.
                    <br><br>
                    Leonardo never gave the
                    painting to the
                    Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left it in his will to his favored apprentice Salaì.
